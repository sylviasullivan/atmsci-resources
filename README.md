Talks from the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project in 2020: [Allison Wing on convective aggregation / organization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EImE4z_POwA)
- *Humidity distribution* - More organized convection &#8594; Moist regions are moister and dry regions are drier, both column-integrated and at individual levels, and the mean state is drier with greater spatial variability in humidity.
- *Cloud distribution* - More organized convection &#8594; Reduction in high cloud fraction (because the mean state is warmer and then increases upper-level stability?) and potential increase in low-level clouds.
- *Energy budget* (Project 1) - More organized convection &#8594; increased outgoing longwave radiation, little change in shortwave radiation, and more cooling to space.
- *Climate sensitivity* - More organized convection &#8594; more negative climate feedback but quantitatively a large range in this feedback. The feedback parameter has a strong correlation with dI_org/dT, the temperature sensitivity of organization.
- *Hydrological cycle* (Project 2) - 50% of mean precipitation comes from mesoscale storms in the tropics, and more organized convection &#8594; 20-25% more mean precipitation. Local extremes also depend on organization but in unclear ways.

[Dynamical core](dynamical-core.pdf) - The dynamical core of an atmospheric model solves the momentum, mass, and energy balances on a spatiotemporal grid using highly efficient numerical methods.

[Physical parameterization](physical-parameterizations.pdf) - Physical parameterizations are use to approximate the processes, like cloud droplet formation and ice crystal nucleation, that occur on subgrid scales.

[Radiative-convective equilibrium](radiative-convective-equilibrium.pdf) - The dominant energetic balance in the tropics is between convective heating and radiative cooling.
